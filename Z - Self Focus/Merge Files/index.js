// Pseudocode
// ----------
// 1. Two files are identified and opened to compare.
// 2. The outcome of the merge when the two files both have the same list item.
// 3. The new file will be the same format as the imported files alphabetically A-Z.
// 4. Big O of the output file will be O(n2) or lower. Efficiency and longevity are priority.

// Sort Pseudocode
// ---------------
// IDEA: Start with array.sort(), then push to more efficient sorting algorithm - recursive and maybe radix? Con is limited to arrays without converting.
// 1. 

// Merge and Export Pseudocode
// ---------------------------
// IDEA: 
// 1. 

// IDEA: push one to an object, if it exists the push to the new object for export
// then sort it there when exporting one at a time.
// So loop the check of one against the other, then merge each time.
