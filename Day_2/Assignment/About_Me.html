  <h2>Nothing like doing what you love!</h2>
  <p>
    I've done a lot. Film production, finance, project manager, and product manager. I've worked on the KC-46 Pegasus and the 777X airplanes focusing on everything from EM all the way to high level program planning. Filmed in Fox Studios and Warner Bros. Studios. Even worked with the armorist from 3:10 to Yuma. And after all that, I find working on software engineering projects to be one of the most interesting and engaging.  I am currently product manager and integrator. My mission is to develop the best product possible while ensuring it is not done in a vaccuum. A visionary providing what my stakeholders require in a time that best meets all of my stakeholders. I do this with a talented team of passionate engineers.
